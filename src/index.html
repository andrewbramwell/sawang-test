                        To ensure the most comfortable and effective massage experience, we recommend avoiding eating for at least 90 minutes before your scheduled session. If you find it necessary to eat, opt for a light meal, as the increased blood flow during a massage can potentially impact digestion. This allows your body to fully relax and benefit from the therapeutic techniques without any discomfort.

                    <p class="cs-item-p">
                        To prepare for your massage, we suggest arriving a few minutes early to allow yourself time to unwind and complete any necessary forms. Dress in comfortable clothing that allows easy access to the areas you wish to focus on during the session. Take a moment to reflect on any specific areas of tension or concern you'd like your therapist to address, as this will help them tailor the massage to your needs.

                    <p class="cs-item-p">
                        After your massage, it's crucial to prioritize hydration to support your body's natural process of eliminating toxins released during the session. We recommend drinking plenty of water and taking time to rest, as your body continues to respond to the therapeutic effects of the massage. It's best to avoid any strenuous physical activities for the remainder of the day, allowing your body to fully integrate the benefits of the massage.

                    Noi is fantastic. So professional and extremely experienced. Following a second hip replacement, I wanted to get my back and legs loosened out. I had complete confidence in Noi, and she worked wonders.
